# Multi-Stop-Bus-Transportation-System
Bus Network Simulation using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) This project models and analyzes a multi-stop bus network using Discrete Event Simulation. It simulates passenger arrivals, bus movements, boarding, alighting, and delays to evaluate system performance such as waiting times and service efficiency.
